Out of Orbit is a space exploration game in augmented reality.

It was designed and built by us as part of our final project phase on the Northcoders software development bootcamp.

The app is intended for young children to learn about the various planets and space technology in our solar system and to earn badges as they demonstrate their knowledge about each. Along the way, space is brought to life in front of their eyes through the use of augmented reality technology.
